INSTALLATION
============

In order to install Perlilog on a UNIX system, just go:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install (as root)

On systems with no GNU make, you should copy the "lib" directory's content
(including its subdirectory, but *not* the "lib" folder itself) to one of
the Perl library directories.

You can get a list of possible directories by typing:

perl -e "print join ',', @INC"

Usually, you'd prefer those which include the word "site", but it's a matter
of taste.

USE WITHOUT INSTALLATION
========================

If installation of Perlilog among the system files is undesired or
impossible, you may copy "lib" directory's content to anywhere. Then,
we tell Perl where it can find the files with a command-line switch:

* perl -w -IC:\perlilog try1.pl on Windows-based systems, assuming that
Perlilog.pm and the subdirectories were put in C:\perlilog\.
* perl -w -I/home/myself/perlilog try1.pl on UNIX/Linux systems,
assuming that Perlilog.pm and the subdirectories were put in
/home/myself/perlilog/.
